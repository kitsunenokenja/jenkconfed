# jenkconfed
Jenkins job configuration XML mass editor utility

This script is designed with the Jenkins job config.xml file structure in
consideration for editing any number of config.xml files simultaneously. It was
put together quickly, and only as far as to solve the immediate needs. It can be
better, and more flexible, but it's a starting point for such a tool. This Perl
code could be adopted easily to operate on any XML files, not just for Jenkins.
